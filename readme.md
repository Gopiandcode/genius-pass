### _Password management for the intellectually-gifted security-oriented individual_

In this modern era of security threats here and there, it can be difficult to keeping on top of your digital security.

One such area we can often find ourselves lacking is in the area of password selection. Hackers seem to always be after our hard earned (using our massive intellects of course) work, always trying to guess our passwords. With increasingly large databases of passwords at their fingertips, it can be difficult to think of secure passwords.

In times of strife like this, it is often best to think back to leaders of days past - men and women who have forged their path through history, not on the backs of 'Password databases' but with their own two hands. 

And so, it is with these words I quote a famous tactician - you may of heard of him - Tsun Zu:

             The best place to hide a leaf is in a forest.

But I hear you say - Kiran. How can I use this advice for stealth and covert operations in defending my own privacy? Well, let me introduce Geniuspass. The security solution for likeminded people like you and me.

Geniuspass aids users in thwarting malicious hackers by not generating *secure* passwords - that's exactly what those pesky hackers want you to do - it generates the **most** pwned passwords possible. 
Through this 180 degree reversal of intentions, Hackers will be left in the dark, completely unable to steal your passwords.
